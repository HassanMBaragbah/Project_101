Project 101 – Explainable AI Summary

- The model relies primarily on short-term temporal and volatility-based features.
- High-confidence errors occur during volatile or atypical market conditions.
- Explainability analysis revealed features that act as both signals and error drivers.
- Recommendations include regime-aware features and improved temporal modeling.

This project emphasizes explainability as a core component of trustworthy machine learning.
